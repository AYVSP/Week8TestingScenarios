**Sol 1**: concepts of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Testing (CT). Using real world scenario as discussed in class to illustrate
importance of CI/CT in improving software quality and efficiency.

Summary of CI and CT Concepts:
Continuous Integration (CI)
CI is a development practice where developers frequently integrate code into a shared repository, usually multiple times a day. The primary goal is to detect issues early in the development cycle. Each code commit triggers automated builds and tests to ensure the new changes don’t break the application.

Core Concepts:
Frequent Integration: Teams commit code often, avoiding "integration hell."
Automated Testing: Runs tests after every commit to catch errors early.
Immediate Feedback: Developers get quick feedback, allowing them to address issues right away.

Continuous Testing (CT)
Continuous Testing extends the concept of CI by ensuring that automated tests cover every stage of the development process, providing feedback on the software’s health continuously.
This improves quality by catching potential issues sooner and ensures that code is always in a deployable state.

Core Concepts:
Testing Throughout the Development Pipeline: CT includes unit tests, integration tests, UI tests, etc., covering each code change from start to finish.
Quality Assurance Automation: Automated QA ensures consistent and reliable feedback.
Risk Mitigation: Early detection reduces the risk of deploying faulty code to production.

Real-World Examples as discussed in class:
 1: CI in GitHub Projects - Many companies use GitHub Actions to automatically test code upon each pull request, verifying that code meets quality standards before merging.
2: Facebook’s use of CT to identify User Interface issues across multiple devices, ensuring each new feature works as intended.

Importance CI/CT:
Improves Software Quality: Continuous testing keeps quality high and consistent.
Increases Efficiency: CI/CD reduces time spent on bug fixes and manual testing, freeing developers to focus on adding new features.

These activity is done to carryout negative, positive and edge cases tests
the requirement is to test a Registration form, with focus on Name, Email and password fields respectively.
So i worked on testing positive, negative and edge cases for each of the web elements
